# FlyingFortress-2015
Small bullet hell game made for a DigiPen summer camp in 2015. Take down bad guys with guns that spray ludicrous amounts of bullets.

Note: This game was created with the <b> Zero Engine and programmed in Zilch. </b> I unfortunately lost
access to both of these things a long time ago, but more power to you if you can run this game!

This was my final project for a Digipen summer camp in 2015. Beware, as there will be bugs!
